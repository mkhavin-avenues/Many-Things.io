## Description
This program creates colorful bubbles that float around the screen. The bubbles:
- Grow and shrink in size over time.
- Change direction and color when they collide or hit the canvas edges.
- Can be popped by clicking on them.

## Goals
- Draw 10+ bubbles on the screen.
- Make them move and change properties dynamically.
- Use conditional statements to handle collisions and user interaction.

## Development Plan
1. Draw a single bubble on the screen.
2. Add movement and size changes to the bubble.
3. Add multiple bubbles and make them bounce off the canvas edges.
4. Implement collision detection and color changes.
5. Add mouse interaction to pop bubbles.

## Advanced Features
- Collision detection between bubbles.
- User interaction through mouse clicks.
